# MWPhotoBrowser â€” A simple iOS photo browser

MWPhotoBrowser is an implementation of a photo browser similar to the native Photos app in iOS. It can display one or more images by providing either `UIImage` objects, file paths to images on the device, or URLs images online. Photos can also be zoomed and panned.

## Usage

MWPhotoBrowser is designed to be presented within a navigation controller. You pass the browser an array of `MWPhoto` objects to display. You can create an `MWPhoto` object by providing a `UIImage` object, a file path to a physical image file, or a URL to an image.

See the code snippet below for an example of how to implement the photo browser. There is also a simple demo project within the project.

    // Create array of `MWPhoto` objects
    NSMutableArray *photos = [NSMutableArray array];
    [photos addObject:[MWPhoto photoWithFilePath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"photo2l" ofType:@"jpg"]]];
    [photos addObject:[MWPhoto photoWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3339128908_7aecabc34b.jpg"]]];
    [photos addObject:[MWPhoto photoWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3590/3329114220_5fbc5bc92b.jpg"]]];

    // Create & present browser
    MWPhotoBrowser *browser = [[MWPhotoBrowser alloc] initWithPhotos:photos];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:browser animated:YES];

If desired, you can choose which photo is displayed first:

    // Create & present browser
    MWPhotoBrowser *browser = [[MWPhotoBrowser alloc] initWithPhotos:photos];
    [browser setInitialPageIndex:2]; // Show second page first
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:browser animated:YES];


## Adding to your project

1. Open `MWPhotoBrowser.xcodeproj`.
2. Drag the `MWPhotoBrowser`, `Subclasses` and `Categories` groups into your project, ensuring you check **"Copy items into destination group's folder"**.
3. Copy the 4 `UIBarButtonItemArrow*.png` images and add them as resources to your bundle.
4. Import `MWPhotoBrowser.h` into your source as required.
